# Data Management Plan

## Data Description
Research has shown the value of diversified thinking and approaches in science and that diverse perspectives can improve our collective ability to solve problems. However, many racial and ethnic groups face the issue of being underrepresented in marine and fisheries science professions, resulting in a workforce that does not reflect the diversity of the United States. This study focuses on the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic groups in marine and fisheries related science professions. The objective of this project is to provide an analysis of how experiences and social identity shape marine and fisheries science related career decisions of individuals across career levels (undergraduates, graduates and professionals). We aim to answer the following research question: 
How does social identity and life experiences influence individuals from underrepresented populations decisions to pursue careers in marine and fisheries science professions?

Five types of data will be produced to answer our research question: 
1.	Demographic Information – potential participants will be invited to complete an opt-in Qualtrics survey containing demographic questions (name, email, age range, career level, race/ethnicity, gender). We will then reach out to those who opted-in and attempt to schedule an in-person or video interview. For participants that are interviewed, demographic data will be saved in a google spreadsheet that also includes information about the interview (date, location, duration), and quantitative data from the interview (agreement statements responses).

2.	Audio Interviews –All interviews will be recorded using a handheld voice recorder. Interviews will follow an interview schedule containing a series of open-ended questions about the participant’s career experiences, racial and ethnic identity, environmental identity, and marine and fisheries science related identity (8 agreement statements). Approximately 75 hours of audio will be produced.

3.	Video Interviews – When in-person interviews are not an option, Zoom will be used to conduct video interviews. Approximately 25 hours of video will be produced.

4.	Field Notes – Hardcopies of our interview schedule, and a field notebook, will be used to record notes and participants responses to a set of 8 agreement statements about marine and fisheries science identity. These responses will be entered into our google spreadsheet for quantitative data analysis. Qualitative data will be obtained from the other parts of the interview. 

5.	Audio and Video Transcription Text Files – All interviews will be transcribed either manually by researchers or using a transcription service to produce text documents of the completed interviews. 
We expect that the amount of data produced will range between approximately 10 – 15 GB and will be influence by the size and quantity of the audio and video files produced.
